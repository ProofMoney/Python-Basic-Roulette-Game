# Python-Basic-Roulette-Game
This is a Roulette game for Python. It was written completely in Jupyter Notebook. 
It works very well.
The only issue that is with it, is when you go bankrupt.
When you DO go bankrupt, anything you type restarts you.
I intended the game to continue only when you type enter.
Thanks for looking at my game.
